      Well HAPPY BIRTHDAYYY ANDDD congratulations dang I missed 2 of these well if you made this far I hope you liked that pocket watch (the artwork on it is beautiful also fun fact owls are symbol of wisdom, it’s all related to Greek goddess Athena so they do harbor good luck) and I would suggest you to read this AFTER your birthday cause the hardest part is gonna to be to finish reading this (lmaoo ) yeah js do me the last courtesy cause this is personal and I trust you with this, hopefully that doesn’t backfire.
      ...
      At last the choice is yours.
