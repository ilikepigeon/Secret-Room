        Well HAPPY BIRTHDAYYY ANDDD congratulations dang I missed 2 of these well if you made this far I hope you liked that pocket watch (the artwork on it is beautiful also fun fact owls are symbol of wisdom, it’s all related to Greek goddess Athena so they do harbor good luck) and I would suggest you to read this AFTER your birthday cause the hardest part is gonna to be to finish reading this (lmaoo ) yeah js do me the last courtesy cause this is personal and I trust you with this, hopefully that doesn’t backfire.
So I never really had a crush before 9th grade maybe one would consider it weird but its true cause I never could quite feel it (it’s hard to explain) it js never felt right but when I joined THSVK I knew like I just knew you were it and ofc I was very immature (LMFAOOO) I didn’t even know how to talk on texts and express how I actually felt, but I managed well you helped a lottt  but yeah what happened has happened 

I just wanna well confess a few things (now the hard to read part and harder to trust) look the gauri thing, I never liked her more than a friend the whole thing was stupid I was js very pissed off by the proposal event yk the chapter play so that’s why I did what I did IMMATURE I know but then I realized js what I had done and yk still I tried to take responsibility for it but I js couldn’t I kept distancing her from me like blocking and ignoring her. I didn’t have the heart to tell her it was all fake I never felt a thing more than js friendship so I avoided being physical, I said it I acted it but I never did anything 0 hugs or hand holding. Yeah a point came when I couldn’t lie anymore and WELL I did smth EVEN more stupid I cared for gauri as a friend and I decided it was better if she js stayed away from a jerk like me and well it came out all wrong YEAHHHH so I told her I slept with a girl in my neighborhood MIND YOU I DO NOT HAVE A neighborhood well I don’t think flats have neighborhood but whatever I said a made up name and well the break up happened never told her it was all a lie but yeah again I accepted things as they were.

I am not really the sort to regret but I do regret not being good enough for back then and not understanding of what you went through. I regret being ignorant, stupid and pathetic wallowing in self-pity. well it’s supposed to be your (happy) birthday but your js reading my pitiful confession LMFAOO I really did have feelings for you and strong ones I think I still do but I don’t think I am good enough if I am being honest and I think I should stop these urges to approach you and yk tell you everything I want to like how I would do anything and everything I can if it meant I could js have one more chance but while writing this I realize I am js not good enough. I feel sad and I don’t wanna accept this I know you feel nothing for me, but I really have never felt this powerless. For me at least you were it and whatever happened back then mattered . My happiest memories were with you. I am starting to hate that I feel this way. I know it’s not an obsession because I don’t keep thinking about you but when I do i get sad, actually its really great at the start but then the more present things become the sadder I get, then again I don’t think I am living in the past because I have perfect understanding of the present. It’s just its been ages since I have written something not PCM so I guess it’s all coming out now. You were this amazing person reallyyyy beautiful and perfect the way I saw it admired and respected. I want to talk to you js one time just to hear things from you (I think after my entrance exams are over) I really have kept this way too long inside me but I just wanna tell things as they are plain and simple and hear what you have to say. Ofc if you don’t want to then its fine cause I have told you my side. I have these suppressed feelings that I denied for so long and I guess all coming out now. The rest is up to you if you wanna hear what those feelings are. 

I mean at least you know what I feel is genuine and I am not doing this cause I am some desperate guy ugh that’s not me. HOPLESS maybe but never desperate, all these girls I know here or even there I really don’t feel anything I just cannot but you, your different. Maybe you have changed and maybe you’re not the same person that’s what I don’t know. Regardless I want to see it for myself and I am willing to make efforts so at least give me the courtesy to tell me your decision on my face if I come on kalaatmak (if mocks go well). At last the choice is yours.
